Real quick how-to-play

The blue bar is your shield strength.  It gets used up when you use your 
shield by pressing SPACE.  The green bar is you stamina.  It gets used up 
when you move.  The faster you move, the faster it gets used up.  To go 
faster press Q, and slower press E.  Move with WASD.  If a goblin hits you
while your shield is up, you kill it.  Otherwise, it kills you.
