Rough guide on how to run.


$ git clone git://github.com/zearen-wover/Hobgoblin
$ cd Hobgoblin
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install --bindir=.
$ ./hobgoblin

Hobgoblin was a quick game created to try SDL in Haskell.  The game is
still in development, but the core functionality is present.  Feel free
to hack it at you discretion.  I hope I provided a proper license, if
not contact me.  I would love to learn about proper licensing.

Real quick how-to-play

The blue bar is your shield strength.  It gets used up when you use your 
shield by pressing SPACE.  The green bar is you stamina.  It gets used up 
when you move.  The faster you move, the faster it gets used up.  To go 
faster press Q, and slower press E.  Move with WASD.  If a goblin hits you
while your shield is up, you kill it.  Otherwise, it kills you.
